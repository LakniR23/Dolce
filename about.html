                <h2>Chef Giovanni Rossi</h2>
                Dolce was established in 2018 by Giovanni Rossi, a passionate Italian baker with a deep love for creating exquisite desserts. Giovanni grew up in a small village in Italy, where he learned the art of baking from his grandmother. Her recipes, rich in tradition and flavor, became the foundation of his craft. After honing his skills in renowned patisseries across Europe, Giovanni decided to bring a taste of authentic Italian confections to the local community. His commitment to quality and innovative approach to classic recipes have made Dolce a beloved destination for cake and cupcake enthusiasts. Over the years, Dolce has expanded its presence across Asia, with several popular outlets in Sri Lanka, where locals and tourists alike savor the delightful blend of Italian artistry and local flavors.
